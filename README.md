# Jekyll Default Theme

> Clean, simple, and minimal theme for jekyll.

## Development

You'll need to install all required packages/gems to be able to run a local [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) server. Follow the [Jekyll Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) instruction.

Once, Jekyll is installed and working, install the required gem for this theme to work.

`bundle install`

Run a local Jekyll server by running `bundle exec jekyll serve` or `jekyll serve`.

Optionally, if you want to auto-reload your browser during development, install [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io) globally and run `browser-sync start --proxy "localhost:4000" --files "_site/*.*"`.

## TO-DO

[ ] Set a base usable theme for a simple site/blog.
