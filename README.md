Once, Jekyll is installed and working, install the required gem for this theme for work.

`bundle install`

Run a local Jekyll server by running `bundle exec jekyll serve` or `jekyll serve`.

If you want to auto-reload your browser during development, install [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io) globally and run `browser-sync start --proxy "localhost:4000" --files "_site/*.*"`.
